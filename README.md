## BACKGROUND
Performing a data analysis project utilizing PostgreSQL to examine data from a fictitious movie rental enterprise, Rockbuster Stealth.

## INTRODUCTION
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## OBJECTIVES
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## DATA
In this Achievement, you’ll be using a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The first thing you’ll need to do is load the data set into the PostgreSQL database. Keep in mind the following points regarding the data set:

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
- Cleaning data: checked and addressed missing values, duplicates, and inconsistency values.
- Joining tables: selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.
- Descriptive Statistics: explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complicated questions.
- Coding with Common Table Expressions (CTEs): designed CTEs that would make code more readable and easier to reuse.
- Reporting results: a Powerpoint presentation with answers to key questions and recommendations.
